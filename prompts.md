1. **Specificity**: Clearly requests a 5-day forecast with % ranges.  
2. **Drivers**: Asks for rationale (sector/global trends) to validate predictions.  
3. **Structured Input**: Lists funds neatly for accuracy.  
4. **Risk Focus**: Ensures critical variables (Fed policy, commodity volatility) are considered.
