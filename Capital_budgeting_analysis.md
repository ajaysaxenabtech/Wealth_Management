**Title:** Automating Capital Budgeting Analysis for Stock-Listed Firms

In today's fast-paced financial world, capital budgeting decisions play a critical role in determining a company's long-term growth. Traditionally, analyzing a firm's capital expenditure (CapEx) and investment decisions required manually sifting through financial statements. But what if we could **automate** this process?

### **Why Automate Capital Budgeting Analysis?**
- Save **time** by extracting financial data automatically.
- Ensure **accuracy** in financial calculations.
- Compare companies **efficiently** for investment decisions.
- Build **real-time** dashboards to track financial health.

### **How to Automate It?**
Using **Python**, we can extract financial data, calculate key capital budgeting metrics, and visualize trends. Here‚Äôs a structured approach:

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Extract Financial Data**
- Use **Yahoo Finance (`yfinance`)** to fetch **balance sheets, cash flows, and income statements**.
- Alternative: Use APIs like **Alpha Vantage, FinancialModelingPrep** for more detailed financial data.

```python
import yfinance as yf
stock = yf.Ticker("RELIANCE.NS")
cash_flow = stock.cashflow
balance_sheet = stock.balance_sheet
print(cash_flow)  # View cash flow statement
```

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Compute Key Capital Budgeting Metrics**
‚úî **CapEx Calculation**  
```python
capex = cash_flow.loc["Capital Expenditures"].abs()
```
‚úî **CapEx-to-Revenue Ratio**  
```python
revenue = stock.financials.loc["Total Revenue"].astype(float)
capex_to_revenue = (capex / revenue) * 100
```
‚úî **Free Cash Flow (FCF)**  
```python
operating_cash_flow = cash_flow.loc["Total Cash From Operating Activities"].astype(float)
fcf = operating_cash_flow - capex
```
‚úî **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)**  
```python
nopat = stock.financials.loc["EBIT"] * (1 - 0.25)
invested_capital = balance_sheet.loc["Total Assets"] - balance_sheet.loc["Total Current Liabilities"]
roic = nopat / invested_capital
```

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Automate Visualization**
‚úî **CapEx Trend Analysis**  
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
capex.plot(kind="bar", title="CapEx Trend")
plt.xlabel("Year")
plt.ylabel("CapEx (in billions)")
plt.show()
```
‚úî **Peer Comparison**  
```python
peers = ["TCS.NS", "INFY.NS", "WIPRO.NS"]
peer_data = {p: yf.Ticker(p).cashflow.loc["Capital Expenditures"].abs() for p in peers}
pd.DataFrame(peer_data).plot(kind="bar", title="CapEx Comparison")
```

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Automate Reporting**
Generate Excel reports for deeper insights.
```python
with pd.ExcelWriter("Capital_Budgeting_Report.xlsx") as writer:
    capex.to_excel(writer, sheet_name="CapEx")
    capex_to_revenue.to_excel(writer, sheet_name="CapEx-to-Revenue")
    fcf.to_excel(writer, sheet_name="Free Cash Flow")
    roic.to_excel(writer, sheet_name="ROIC")
print("Report Generated!")
```

### **The Future of Financial Analysis üöÄ**
By integrating **real-time dashboards** (e.g., Streamlit, Power BI) and automating periodic runs with **Airflow/Cron Jobs**, we can make financial insights accessible and actionable.
