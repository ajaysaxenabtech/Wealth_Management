In the case of equity trading in India, the process and timeline for moving funds from your savings account to your demat account, then to your trading account, purchasing securities, holding them, and eventually selling them to receive the funds back into your savings account involves several steps, each with its own specific timeline:

1. **Transfer from Savings to Trading Account**: When you transfer funds from your savings account to your trading account, the transfer is typically instantaneous if the trading account and the savings account are with the same bank. If they are with different banks, it might take a few hours or up to one business day.

2. **Buying Securities**: Once the funds are in your trading account, you can use them to buy securities immediately during the trading hours of the stock exchange (NSE/BSE). The purchase and allocation of securities to your demat account are based on the T+2 settlement cycle.

3. **Holding Period**: In case, holding the securities for 5 days. This period starts after the securities are credited to your demat account, which would be two business days after the purchase.

4. **Selling Securities**: After holding for 5 days, you can sell your securities. The selling process also occurs during trading hours, and the transaction will again follow a T+2 settlement cycle.

5. **Receiving Funds**: Once the securities are sold, the proceeds from the sale will be credited to your trading account typically on the T+2 settlement day after the sale.

6. **Transfer to Savings Account**: Finally, you can transfer the funds from your trading account back to your savings account. This transfer, similar to the initial funding, is usually immediate if both accounts are with the same bank, or it can take up to one business day if they are with different banks.

### Example Timeline:
- **Day 0**: Transfer money from savings to trading account and buy securities.
- **Day 2**: Securities credited to your demat account (T+2 settlement).
- **Day 7**: Sell the securities after holding for 5 days.
- **Day 9**: Sale proceeds credited to your trading account (T+2 settlement post-sale).
- **Day 10**: Transfer funds back to savings account (could be immediate or take 1 day).

This timeline can vary based on bank processes, holidays, and the specifics of your brokerage firm's policies. Always confirm the exact process and timeline with your broker to ensure there are no discrepancies.
