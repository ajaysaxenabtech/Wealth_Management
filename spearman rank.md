## **Using Spearman Rank Correlation for Building a Deposit Stability Model**

💰 **How stable are customer deposits?** Financial institutions need to predict deposit retention to manage liquidity, optimize risk, and offer personalized banking products. 

One powerful yet often overlooked tool for feature selection in deposit stability modeling is the **Spearman Rank Correlation Coefficient (ρ)**. Unlike Pearson correlation, which assumes linearity, Spearman **identifies monotonic relationships** between variables—even when the connections are non-linear.

### **🔍 Why Use Spearman Rank Correlation?**
✅ **Captures Non-Linear Trends** – Works well when deposit stability has complex relationships with factors like transaction frequency or interest rate sensitivity.  
✅ **Robust to Outliers** – Since it ranks data rather than using raw values, extreme fluctuations don’t distort the analysis.  
✅ **Effective for Ordinal Data** – Features like credit scores, income brackets, and customer loyalty tiers are naturally ranked, making Spearman the ideal choice.

### **📊 How It Works:**
1️⃣ Collect deposit-related data: **Transaction frequency, tenure, income, balance trends, interest rate sensitivity, etc.**  
2️⃣ Rank both the **dependent variable** (deposit stability) and independent variables.  
3️⃣ Compute **Spearman's ρ** using the formula:

$$
\rho = 1 - \frac{6 \sum d_i^2}{n(n^2 - 1)}
$$

where \( d_i \) is the rank difference and \( n \) is the sample size.  
4️⃣ Interpret correlations:
   - **Strong Positive (ρ → +1)**: Customers with **higher balances, longer tenure, and frequent transactions** have more stable deposits.
   - **Strong Negative (ρ → -1)**: Customers who are **interest-rate-sensitive or frequently withdraw large amounts** have less stable deposits.
   - **Near Zero (ρ ≈ 0)**: No monotonic relationship exists.

5️⃣ Use the most significant variables in **ML models** (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or AI-driven forecasting models) to enhance deposit stability predictions.

### **📈 Exhibit: Spearman Correlation in Action**
Below is a visualization of **Spearman Rank Correlation between Deposit Stability and Key Features**:

| Feature | Spearman Rank Correlation (ρ) |
|---------|-------------------------------|
| **Transaction Frequency** | +0.72 (High Stability) |
| **Account Tenure** | +0.65 (Positive Impact) |
| **Average Balance** | +0.80 (Strong Retention) |
| **Withdrawal Frequency** | -0.68 (Less Stability) |
| **Interest Rate Sensitivity** | -0.55 (Rate-sensitive deposits) |

🔹 **Takeaway:** Features with **high absolute Spearman correlation** are the best predictors for deposit stability. Selecting the right variables ensures **accurate deposit retention models, better liquidity forecasting, and enhanced customer insights.** 🚀
